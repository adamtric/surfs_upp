# surfs_upp

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to help determin the validity of opening an Ice Cream and Surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. By understanding weather trends by month, we can determine if the business will be sustainable year round. After failed attempts with similar ventures, location and the weather in that location will be the major factors in determining the success of the business.

## Results
* The mean temperature in Oahu in June is a little less than 75 degrees. The mean temperature in December is a little greater than 71 degrees.
* The minimum temperature in Oahu in June has been 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December has been 56 degrees.
* The maximum temperature in Oahu in June has been 85 degrees and the maximimum temperature in December has been 83 degrees.

## Summary

As we can see from the results of our project and the two dataframes we constructed, we can see there is no sizable, significant differences in weather that would cause the business to suffer in the colder months. The average temperatures have a difference of 4 degrees, the maximum temperatures have a difference of 2 degrees and the minimum temperatures have a difference of 8 degrees. The weather in Oahu seems to stay fairly consistent throughout the year and would thus set up a sustainable business.

I would, however, perform a couple of additional queries to ensure our weather would stay nice enough for people to enjoy surfing as well as ice cream. One additional query that would be necessary would be to understand the weather descriptions for each month. If it mostly sunny all year round, this will have a positive impact on the success of the business. We want to make certain the temperatures and type of weather match up. 

This leads me to an additional query I would like to run and that would be to understand the amount of rain fall from each month. Again, the success of the business may depend on what type of weather that comes across the area. 75 degrees and rainy is not the ideal combination for success for a Surf Shop. If it rains more in certain months this may derail the sustainability of the business and can thus lower the validity of this venture.
